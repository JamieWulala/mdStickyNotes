# mdStickyNotes
It's a sticky notes like the mac original one, and it can render md txt and set up script

### initial thoughts
I like the sticky notes on Mac but I want it to be more powerful, like be able to
  *1. render mark down text
  2. set up template by commond/ (/todo, /todoList)
  
  no clue how to do it on MacOS, let's kick it!
